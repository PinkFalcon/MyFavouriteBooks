  <h2>The Great Gatsby, by F Scott Fitzgerald</h2>
 <img src="http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9789895621002.jpg" alt="">
<div class="book1">
  <p>There’s a reason why The Great Gatsby is commonly dubbed one of the greatest novels ever written. Fitzgerald’s depiction of extravagance and
    greed challenges the idea of the American Dream, exposes the insincerity of the wealthy, and illustrates how social class played a major role
    in your “success” in the 1920’s. With numerous symbols and hidden meanings throughout the book, it’s worth reading a second time (or third,
    or fourth).</p>

  <h2>Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison</h2>
  <img src="http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780679732761.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="book2">
  <p>Ellison combines a fluid, compelling writing style with a robust exploration of life as a black man in mid-century America. The unnamed narrator
    tells his story from his youth in a small Southern town, where he wins a scholarship to college that he can secure only after taking part in a
    brutal fight for the amusement of rich white sponsors, to his engagement with rising black nationalism and his realization that his color renders
    him, for all practical purposes, invisible to society at large.</p>

  <h2>Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen</h2>
  <img src="http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9781509826872.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="book3">
  <p>Pride and Prejudice is one of the most popular novels in English literature to illustrate social issues. Featuring a strong female character,
    Lizzy’s intelligence, charm, and resilience shows off a feminist perspective and social class deconstruction that was rare in the 19th century.
    If that isn’t enough to want to read this popular classic, how about an enchanting romance story and comedy, too?</p>

  <h2>The Murder of Roger Akroyd, by Agatha Christie</h2>
  <img src="http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780062073563.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="book4">
  <p>Christie invented a whole mess of what we think of as modern thriller tropes, and you can draw a direct line between Ackroyd and books like
    Gone Girl and The Woman in the Window. The term “unreliable narrator” might as well have a small portrait of Roger Ackroyd next to it in the
    dictionary, and the only way you’ll ever appreciate the term is to read this book. Probably twice.</p>

  <h2>The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
  <img src="http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780399501487.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="book5">
  <p>If you’re going to read a fantasy, read the ur-fantasy, the godfather of the entire genre in its modern incarnation. If you love fantasy
    but haven’t read LOTR, you might be missing out—everything you love about the genre has its roots here (even if only to reject everything
    Tolkien laid down), and few fantasy epics have as deep a backstory.</p>
